# ➕ Ammplify 
Ammplify is a liquidity management protocol that runs as a smart-contract layer on top of existing Uniswap V3 pools; it does not replace Uniswap V3 but acts as an aggregator and redistribution engine that holds LP positions in Uniswap V3 on behalf of users. The protocol aggregates many user positions over overlapping tick ranges into a shared segment-tree representation and deploys them as one or a few Uniswap V3 positions, reducing fragmentation. It also runs a reservation market: privileged Taker participants borrow virtual liquidity from the Maker pool and pay continuous borrow fees, forming an on-chain interest-rate market for concentrated liquidity. Auto-compounding is supported: fee income from Uniswap swap fees and Taker borrow fees can be reinvested into the user’s liquidity position. The system is deployed as a single EIP-2535 Diamond with multiple facets (Admin, Maker, Taker, Pool, View, etc.) sharing one storage namespace. Every Ammplify-managed pool maps to an existing Uniswap V3 pool, and all positions are held under the Diamond’s address. An NFTManager wraps Ammplify assets as transferable NFTs, and an UniV3Decomposer allows migrating existing Uniswap V3 NFT positions into Ammplify Maker positions in one transaction.
